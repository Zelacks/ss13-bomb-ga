============
Code that is stored for personal use

It is essentially a "genetic algorithm" (It hardly uses any of the quirks of GA so I dunno if I can even call it that)
that uses code identical to tgstation to determine the combination of gases in tank transfer valves, will create a bomb
with the biggest bomb

As I said, the code is currently for personal use, aka it is filled with nothing but magic numbers and hardcoded
interfaces, and tweaks. Good luck getting it to work, you probably deserve it if you can decode how everything works
(A big hint is that I am a shitty coder and a dirty cheater that uses the debugger to get things to work how I want it)
